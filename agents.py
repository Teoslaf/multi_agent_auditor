	Creating Agents Cheat Sheet:
    - Think like a boss. Work backwards from the goal and think which employee youu need to hire to get the job done.
    - Define the Captain of the crew who orient the other agents towards the goal.
    - Define which experts the captain needs to comunicate with and delegate taskt to.
    
    Goal:
   - Create a comprehensive smart contract security audit report that:
        1. Analyzes smart contract code for vulnerabilities and security risks
        2. Identifies potential gas optimization opportunities
        3. Reviews contract logic and business logic flaws
        4. Checks for compliance with best practices and standards
        5. Assesses centralization risks and trust assumptions
        6. Provides detailed recommendations for improvements
        7. Generates a professional audit report with findings severity levels
    
    Captain/Manager/Boss:
    - Lead Smart Contract Auditor (Technical Lead)
    
    Employees/Experts to hire:
    1. Security Vulnerability Expert
    2. Business Logic Analyzer
    3. On-Chain Data Analyst
    4. Formal Verification Expert
    5. White hat hacker
    6. Documentation Specialist
    
    Notes:
    - Agent should be results driven and have a clear goal in mind
    - Role is their job title
    - Goals should actionable
    - Backstory is their resume
